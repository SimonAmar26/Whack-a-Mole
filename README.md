# Whack-a-Mole
Develop a Whack-a-Mole game using Python’s Turtle module. In this game, “moles” pop up at random positions on the screen for a short period, and the player must “whack” them by clicking on them with the mouse before they disappear. The goal is to whack as many moles as possible within a set time limit.
