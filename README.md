# Whack-a-Mole
Develop a Whack-a-Mole game using Python’s Turtle module. In this game, “moles” pop up at random positions on the screen for a short period, and the player must “whack” them by clicking on them with the mouse before they disappear. The goal is to whack as many moles as possible within a set time limit.

**Requirements of the Project:**
- Well-documented source code hosted on Gitlab or GitHub, using only Python and the Turtle module.
- Comprehensive report that formally describes the problem, the solution, the challenges, and how the group overcame them.
- Video that demonstrates the game and showcases its features and gameplay.

**Regarding the Report:**
- Introduction: possibly about what is the game and its development.
- The Problem:
  - Context of problem: what is our problem about? => has to do with the whack-a-mole.
  - Formalization of problem: breaking down the main problem into sub-problems => has to do with timing of moles, background, point systems, etc...
  - Algorithm used: demonstration of which algorithms did we use in order to code our game and why did we choose the algorithms that we did.
- Opinions (individual ones for each group member):
  - What did you learn?
  - What was difficult?
  - Overall, how was your experience?
- Conclusion:
  - Final remarks
  - What was the end result of our code?
